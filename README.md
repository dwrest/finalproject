# finalproject
Since the first project, Dennis implemented the Customer Feedback page that creates a form that uses localStorage, eventLister, elements of CSS, java script, if/else for feedback and made it aesthetically pleasing. Ashley implemented the Contact us page that uses conditional statements, elements of javascript and form such as checkboxes. Dennis also implement the localStorage on the Contact Us Page. Both of us created CSS pages to create the forms. 
Dennis fixed up the menu and navbar on all of the pages.
